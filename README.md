# MCPackTool
Goal: to allow user-friendly management, creation, and merging of minecraft resourcepacks

Curently under development, so barely anything actually works. Use at your own risk.

latest edit: experimenting with OpenGL to render Minecraft assets in 3d from resourcepacks. A lot of work to go...


# Setting up the environment
This is really finniky so buckle up...

- 1) installing QT

- 2) pulling via git

to be finished...
