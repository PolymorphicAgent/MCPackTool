# MCPackTool
Goal: to allow user-friendly management, creation, and merging of minecraft resourcepacks

Curently under development, so barely anything actually works. Use at your own risk.

latest edit: experimenting with OpenGL to render Minecraft assets in 3d from resourcepacks. A lot of work to go...


# Setting up the environment
This is really finniky so buckle up...

**ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS 64 bit - Any other OS's are not guaranteed to work.**

1) Installing / Setting up QT

    - please note that this will take up approximately 40 GB of storage space depending on your operating system.

        a) Download the QT installer from [this site](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss).
        
        b) You may have to create a free account with QT.
        
        c) I reccomend keeping the default installation directory (at C:/Qt)
        
        d) Select "Qt 6.9 for desktop development"
        
        e) Finish the installation process. It will take a while!

2) pulling via git

to be finished...
