# MCPackTool
Goal: to allow user-friendly management, creation, and merging of minecraft resourcepacks

Curently under development, so barely anything actually works. Use at your own risk.

latest edit: experimenting with OpenGL to render Minecraft assets in 3d from resourcepacks. A lot of work to go...


# Setting up the environment
This is really finniky so buckle up...

**ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS 64 bit - Any other OS's are not guaranteed to work.**

1) Installing / Setting up QT

    - please note that this will take up approximately 40 GB of storage space depending on your operating system.

        a) Download the QT installer from [this site](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss).
        
        b) You may have to create a free account with QT.
        
        c) I reccomend keeping the default installation directory (at C:/Qt)
        
        d) Select "Qt 6.9 for desktop development"
        
        e) Finish the installation process. It will take a while!

2) Cloning this project via git

    - Once QT installed, you are ready to clone this project and set up the enivronment!

        a) Open command prompt to your Documents folder, making sure it's NOT your OneDrive Documents (onedrive will attempt to upload everything...) or wherever you keep your projects

        b) 
to be finished...
