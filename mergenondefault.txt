-cannot directly exec prompt from worker thread
-use signals/slots for data transfers b/w worker thread and conflict prompter (utils?)

Brainstorm:

-somewhere (prob. utils) have a static slot funct. connected to a signal from the merger thread
  -creates the conflict prompt and emits another signal somehow connected back to the merger thread
-merger thread has somehow been waiting while the user selects stuff on the prompt
-loop the above for every node conflict

Info I know:

-I can create a static slot function in utils that does what it's supposed to
 i.e prompt the user and emit the signal
-I know how to connect a static slot to the thread's signals

Info I need:

-How do I connect the utils' static slot back to the worker thread (mb use a slot?)
-How the heck am I supposed to wait in the worker thread for a signal?

Gathered info:

-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31358646/qt5-how-to-wait-for-a-signal-in-a-thread (accepted answer)
    -uses qtimer to wait for a signal in the worker thread

Todo:

create static slot in Utils that prompts user and emits signal w/ payload (int); ✅
-create conflictprompt instance ✅
-set conflictprompt options ✅
finish ConflictPrompt class (finish choice selection) ✅
-> add 'cancel' button, and 'apply to rest' button
-move step 1 to another class in GUI thread ✅
use info on stackoverflow to wait in thread for response and gather int data;✅
create preprocessing that gets the QImage and discriminates against jsons✅

rethink progression algorithm
